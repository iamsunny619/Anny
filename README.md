Hi there,
before you going through codes, this application is based for component implementation(not for best UI design), so u may find some design fault and 
not that good design(ui), and here are some keys point im using:-
  -Kotlin,  (but also can work with java)
  -Android Jetpack
  -Mvvm
  -Dagger
  -DataBiniding
  -Timber
  -Multidex
  -Mvvm with Clean Architecture(as for now only im using hard codes data, but soon i will implement mvvm with clean architecture)
  -and many more new stuffs(most will be implemented)
  
in this project i have created Some base classes and base file and also have some code(took from blogs and google codelabs and others.)
